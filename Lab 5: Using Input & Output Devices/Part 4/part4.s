//In this part you are to write an assembly language program that implements a real-time clock.
//Display the time on the seven-segment displays HEX3 âˆ’ 0 
//in the format SS:DD, where SS are seconds and DD are hundredths of a second.
//Measure time intervals of 0.01 seconds in your program by using polled I/O with the ARM A9 Private Timer.
//You should be able to stop/run the clock by pressing any pushbutton KEY.
//When the clock reaches 59:99, it should wrap around to 00:00.
