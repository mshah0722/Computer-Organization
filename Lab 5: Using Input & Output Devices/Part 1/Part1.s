//Part1 : Write an ARM assembly language program that displays a decimal digit on the seven-segment display HEX0.
//The other seven-segment displays HEX5 âˆ’ 1 should be blank.
//If KEY0 is pressed on the board, you should set the number displayed on HEX0 to 0
//If KEY1 is pressed then increment the displayed number, 
//If KEY2 is pressed then decrement the number
//Pressing KEY3 should blank the display, and pressing any other KEY after that should return the display to 0.
//When you are not pressing any KEY the Data register provides 0
//When you press KEYi the Data register provides the value 1 in bit position i.
//Once a button-press is detected, be sure that your program waits until the button is released.
