Assembly, C, Verilog code developed for ECE 243: Computer Organization Course

Labs 1-2: Creating an enhanced processor using Verilog which ontains a number of 16-bit registers, a multiplexer, an adder/subtracter, and a control unit (finite state machine). The processor can perform Read & Write operations using memory and other devices.

Lab 3: Learning how to use the ARM* Cortex* A9 processor that is included in Intelâ€™s Cyclone V SoC devices. The programs are written in the ARM assembly language that can be executed on the DE1-SoC board using the Intel FPGA Monitor Program software to compile, load and run the application programs.

Lab 4: This exercise is focused towards common Logic Instructions that are often needed in many embedded applications. Logic instructions are useful for manipulation of bit strings and for dealing with data at the bit level where only a few bits may be of special interest.  They are essential in dealing with input/output tasks. The ARM processor in the DE1-SoC Computer will be utilized again.

Lab 5: The purpose of this exercise is to investigate the use of devices that provide input and output capabilities for a processor. There are two basic techniques for dealing with I/O devices: program-controlled polling and interrupt-driven approaches. The polling approach will be used in this exercise. The programs will be executed on the ARM processor in the DE1-SoC Computer system. Parallel portinterfaces, as well as a timer module, will be used as examples of I/O hardware.

Lab 6: The purpose of this exercise is to investigate the use of interrupts for the ARM processor, using assembly-language code. For this exercise, the exceptions processing mechanisms for the ARM  processor will be explored along with the operation of the ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC).

Lab 7: The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to display images and perform animation. Using the ARM processor that is included as part of the pre-built computer system for the DE1-SoC board. I will be displaying graphics by using a VGA terminal connected to the video-out port on your board. This exercise is completed using C code with the ARM processor and the video-out port.
